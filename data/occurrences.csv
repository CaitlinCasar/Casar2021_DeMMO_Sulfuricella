Potential vanishing of glaciers in this part of Europe could endanger existing glacial lakes, which points to the need of conservation and biodiversity studies of this ecological niche. The studies of microbial communities in glacial lakes, especially in southeast Europe are rare and even neglected. It is well recognized that unexplored ecological niches and metabolic potential as well as new molecular frameworks of their microbial communities could be a gold mine of secondary metabolites with importance for biotechnology, medicine and pharmacy. Our goal was to assess the bacterial communities from selected Western Balkans glacial lakes. Selection of lakes was based on exposure to anthropological influences.

Amplification of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes were performed and sequenced in Illumina MiSeq with a sequence depth of about 100 thousand readpairs. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic MOSJ-ICE16 data sets collection comprises highly complex and diverse microbial communities with a marked biogeographic pattern of distribution.

Although low to moderate oiling of coastal wetlands has been shown to impact ecosystem functions, studies focused on determining long term impacts of oil spills on marsh vegetation, microbial community composition and associated effects on nitrogen cycling are relatively limited.

We applied a multi-phase approach combining microcosm enrichments and pure culture studies with methane oxidation potential measurements and high throughput sequencing. We focused on incubation conditions with a limited O2 availability as observed in the natural environment. 16S rRNA gene profiling showed that with N2 as the only available nitrogen source, communities were dominated by Methylomonas species as the major methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). In the presence of added nitrate however, Methylobacter species were the dominant MOB. Pure culture studies of Methylomonas and Methylobacter isolated from the same environment and incubated in the same way confirmed that the growth of a Methylomonas strain was not significantly affected when N2 was the only provided nitrogen source, while growth of a Methylobacter strain was negatively impacted. By further exposing long-term methane fed microbial communities to different nitrogen sources, intraspecific dynamics of non-methanotrophic community members were observed, suggesting nitrate as an additional selective factor for co-occurring species. Our results show that provided nitrogen source is an important factor determining specific responses of individual community members and consequently affecting community composition and overall methane consumption.",47.63,-122.25,Lake Washington,2.65E-05,a6ab3f74-b667-4423-9df6-af18d73783f0,16s SSU,

,,freshwater,sediment,Development and validation of a multi-trophic metabarcoding biotic index for benthic organic enrichment biomonitoring using a salmon farm case-study.,"Salmon farms are often associated with strong benthic enrichment gradients. Routine monitoring is usually required by regulation, and has traditionally been based on benthic macrofaunal communities. This is reliant on taxonomic expertise, excludes analsyis of micro-organisms and turn-around times can be slow, limiting opportunities for adaptive management. Environmental metabarcoding is a powerful high-throughput sequencing-based technique that is promising for identifying and quantifying assemblages of benthic organisms for biomonitoring. Previous studies have demonstrated relationships between specific taxonomic groups (e.g., bacteria, foraminifera or other eukaryotes) and anthropogenic effects. However, there is uncertainty around applicability at larger spatial and temporal scales, and the absence of fixed categorical scales makes the use of data challenging for routine biomonitoring. In this study, we analysed 105 sediment samples collected over three years from three salmon farms spanning two separate bioregions. Environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/eRNA) metabarcoding of three taxonomic groups (foraminifera [For], bacteria [Bac], and general eukaryotes [Euk]) was undertaken in parallel with traditional macrofaunal and biochemical analysis (which were used to calculate an Enrichment Stage [ES] index for each sample). The most abundant 200 to 250 Operational Taxonomic Units in each taxonomic group were assigned to Eco-Groups (EG) using a quantitative, quality-based method. These were then used to develop a Metabarcoding Biotic Index (MBI) for each group individually (For-MBI, Bac-MBI, and Euk-MBI) and in combination (multi-trophic MBI; mt-MBI). Based on our assessment criteria we robustly allocated ca. 500 EG to a wide range of known and unknown taxa. Using both the development (year 1 [Y1] and 2 [Y2]) and independent validation (year 3) datasets the weakest correlation was between For-MBI and ES (eDNA/RNA, R2 = 0.731 to 0.850), whereas strong correlations were obtained between the mt-MBI and, or when just Bac and Euk data (mt[Bac+Euk]-MBI) were combined (eDNA/RNA, R2 &gt; 0.900). Consequently, we suggest that foraminifera be excluded from the mt-MBI, which will reduce analytical time and costs. The strong correlations obtained between the mt-MBI and ES confirms that it has the potential to complement or even replace current fish farm biomonitoring techniques in the near future.",-41.24,174.24,NA,2.24E-05,e5a6c31a-a253-4f87-a2a7-f2d18cd82be0,16s SSU,

The method presented herein was based on the hypothesis that organohalide respiring bacteria would be more hydrophobic than other bacteria as a result of their niche dehalogenating hydrophobic compounds. To test this hypothesis, a method was developed to separate putative organohalide respiring bacteria at the interface between a hydrophobic organic solvent and aqueous media.

Here we investigate the microbial community on the surface of Aldegondabreen, a valley glacier in Svalbard which is supplied with carbon and nutrients from different sources across its surface, including colonies of seabirds. We used a combination of geochemical analysis (surface debris, ice and meltwater), quantitative PCR (targeting the 16S rRNA and amoA genes), pyrosequencing and multivariate statistical analysis to better understand the ecology of prokaryotic microbes on the surface on Aldegondabreen and their role in nitrogen cycling.

,,other,soil,Bacerial and archaeal diversity in Central Park,"Soil biota play key roles in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, however, compared to our knowledge of aboveground plant and animal diversity, the biodiversity found in soils remains largely uncharacterized. Here we present an assessment of soil biodiversity and biogeographical patterns across Central Park in New York City that spanned all three domains of life, demonstrating that even an urban, managed system can harbor large amounts of undescribed soil biodiversity. Despite high variability across the Park, belowground diversity patterns were predictable based on soil characteristics, with prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities exhibiting overlapping biogeographical patterns. Further, Central Park soils harbored nearly as many distinct soil microbial taxa and types of soil communities as we found in biomes across the globe (including arctic, tropical and desert soils). This integrated cross-domain investigation highlights that the amount and patterning of novel and uncharacterized diversity at a single urban location matches that observed across natural ecosystems spanning multiple biomes and continents. Our data therefore suggest that the dominant factors controlling soil biodiversity differ markedly to those controlling aboveground plant and animal diversity.",40.8,-73.96,United States of America,3.67E-05,4a2b864b-f3b8-4964-8147-c28e7f73499e,16s SSU,
